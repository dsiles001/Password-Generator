# Password-Generator

# Input
Enter the pieces of data that you want to be used when generating every possible password combination. Disregard the requirement for 10 or more words. If you use ten or more words as your data entries, be warned that this will result in a very large text file. Make sure you have enough space for this text file.

Once you have entered your data entries, you will be prompted to enter the minimum and the maximum length of characters each password generated should be. Input will be in the format "Min Max", where there is a space between the two values. If no limits are entered, then every possible password combination will be generated without limits on length. [WARNING] No limits on generated passwords can result in very large file sizes. 

# Output
The output will be in the form of a separate .txt file named passswords.txt. Once the script has generated every possible combination, a "finished" message will appear. You can then check the passwords.txt and use it for your task.
